# Dialogic

> Master new languages through immersive role-play. Chat your way to fluency with Dialogic’s imaginative AI-driven scenarios.

## About the Project

Dialogic is a client-side language learning application that leverages advanced Language Models to provide immersive, conversational role-play scenarios. It allows users to bring their own API keys for various LLM providers (Anthropic, Google Gemini, OpenAI, or local Ollama) and practice their target languages in a dynamic, AI-driven environment. Everything runs in your browser, keeping your data local and secure.

The application features a modern, responsive chat interface designed for natural conversations. Beyond simple chat, Dialogic acts as a dedicated language coach, analyzing your input to provide real-time feedback and corrections, helping you improve your fluency and accuracy as you interact.
